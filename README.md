SyntHacks II submission: Wheel of Marvel Quotes.

It's a much more complicated version of Hangman. You're given a quote to guess, and you have to puzzle it out before the computer can. Consonant guesses are free, but vowels cost $10. If you're clever enough to know the whole phrase, you can make -- or lose -- $100. Whoever reaches $500 first wins!
